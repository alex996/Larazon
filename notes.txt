- moving User to Models:

  - update packages (e.g. JWT)
  - update your own code: grep -R 'User' / 'App/User'
- Admin / UserController / @show
  views
    admin
      users
        show
  resource('users')

- repository, separating Eloquent concerns into separate classes
- api pagination
- add proper responses (Dingo?)
- time to transform models too!!
